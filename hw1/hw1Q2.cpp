If your have an odd number of CloudCoinsTM, you lose 15 CloudCoinsTM and the remaining amount of CloudCoinsTM is doubled.

If your have an even number of CloudCoinsTM, you lose 99 CloudCoinsTM but the amount you have remaining is tripled.

If you have more than 1,000,000 CloudCoinsTM your total loops back around (so 1,000,007 CloudCoinsTMÂ  becomes just 7 CloudCoinsTM). Likewise, if your total goes below 0 CloudCoinsTM it ALSO loops around (so -7 CloudCoinsTM would become 999,993 CloudCoinsTM).
